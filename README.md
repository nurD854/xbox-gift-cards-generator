Games and DLC (Downloadable Content): Whether it's a brand-new title or a classic favorite, Xbox Gift Cards can be used to purchase games from the Microsoft Store. This includes full game purchases, expansions, and additional downloadable content (DLC) that enhance the gaming experience.

Xbox Game Pass: One of the most popular services among Xbox gamers is Xbox Game Pass, which offers access to a library of games that can be played as long as you’re subscribed. Xbox Gift Cards can be used to pay for Game Pass subscriptions, including Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which also includes EA Play and Xbox Live Gold.

Movies and TV Shows: In addition to games, Xbox Gift Cards can be used to buy or rent movies and TV shows from the Microsoft Store. This makes them a great gift for people who enjoy streaming content in addition to gaming.

Xbox Live Gold: For those who enjoy multiplayer gaming, Xbox Live Gold is a subscription service that provides online access to play with others. Gift cards can be used to purchase or renew an Xbox Live Gold subscription.

Microsoft Store Purchases: Xbox Gift Cards are not limited to gaming alone. They can also be used for a variety of products on the Microsoft Store, including apps, software, and even devices like tablets or laptops.

In-Game Currency: Many games offer in-game currencies (like V-Bucks in Fortnite, or FIFA Points in EA Sports games). Xbox Gift Cards can be used to purchase this virtual currency, enhancing the gaming experience with new skins, characters, and other in-game items.
